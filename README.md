# Gyroid-indentation
Python code for the extraction and visualization of nanoindentation data across multiple indent steps in a single experiment. 


System is a Triboscan Quasi! 
Berkovich nanoindentation tests on gyroid films were performed using Hysitron Ub1 Nanoindenter system with a maximum indentation force of 11 mN and a depth resolution of 0.04 nm. The Berkovich tip had a tip radius of 50 nm and the usual Berkovich half angle of 65.35Â° measured from the axis to one of the pyramidal flats.


For each test 12 interrupted load/unload cycles were performed whereby the peak load in each cycle was progressively increased to the maximum machine load capacity of 11 mN over the 12 cycles. Each loading and unloading segment was 2s in duration with a 2s hold between these segments. During each unloading cycle the load was reduced to 50% of the load just prior to unloading.


The modulus and hardness were extracted from these measurements using the standard Oliver and Pharr procedure. We note in passing that experiments were also performed by increasing the above loading times by a factor of 10: no appreciable change in the measurements was observed indicating that the responses measured here are reasonably strain rate insensitive.


Samples were indented in a 4 by 4 array with a 50um spacing in both lateral directions to ensure the associated strain fields did not interact between indents.
